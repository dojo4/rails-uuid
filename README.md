This plugin changes the default handling of primary keys in rails. It
currently supports sqlite, sqlite3 and postgre sql. 

By default, new migrations will use a UUID as the primary key. Should you
already have tables, they will still use auto incrementing IDs. 

You can disable the use of UUIDs for a specific table by calling
create_table_without_uuid instead of create_table in your migration. 

In your migrations, calls to t.references and t.belongs_to should
automatically figure out if the destination model is setup for UUIDs. If the
model does not already exist (and have a valid table in the DB) it will
default to an auto incrementing integer. You can force a traditional
relationship by calling t.references_without_uuid. The ability to force a UUID
in the references call is coming soon. 

This is a fairly new library and has not been tested heavily, but seems to
work with rails 3.0.3.

There are no working tests - I've still got to write some. testing framework
has been largely stolen from ActiveRecord. 

The gems in the repo are currently out of date.
